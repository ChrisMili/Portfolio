     <span><a href="https://trinket.io/python/dc7810514c" target="_blank">This project is using a python library called turtle and making a cool illusion. Some things I really enjoyed about this was seeing it once it's done. It looks really cool and you can look at it for hours.</a></span>
     <span><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/179616969/" target="_blank">This project is a little remastered version of the Three little pigs. It's not done yet but is still good. Some things I really enjoyed about this was making it. It took about a week but was still enjoyable to make.</a></span>
     <span><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/183117209/" target="_blank">This project is Doom of the Witches Broom a game I made using scratch. Some things I really enjoyed about this was that it's short and easy to play only a few controls. If you mess around with the code you can change the settings of the entities.</a></span>

     <span><a href="https://repl.it/@ChristianWright/Tribute-Page-1-2" target="blank_">This project is a project about me. It's simple and just uses 3 words to describe me, that simple but so beautiful.</a></span>
     <span><a href="https://repl.it/@ChristianWright/Final-Project" target="blank_">This project is a cat that I filtered using python code. It was difficult but at least now I know what it's like to filter images.</a></span>
